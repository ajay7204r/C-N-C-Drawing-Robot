Stepper Motors:

Stepper motors control the movement of the robot along the X and Y axes. Connect these motors to the appropriate driver modules.
Motor Drivers:

Use motor driver modules (such as A4988 or DRV8825) to control the stepper motors. These drivers interpret signals from the Arduino and convert them into precise movements.
Frame and Carriage:

Construct a stable frame to support the motors and other components. Attach a carriage to the motors to hold the drawing tool.
Drawing Tool:

The tool could be a pen, pencil, or other writing instrument. It needs to be attached securely to the carriage.
Limit Switches:

Implement limit switches at the ends of each axis to detect when the robot reaches its limits and prevent damage.
Power Supply:

Provide a suitable power supply for the motors and other components.
